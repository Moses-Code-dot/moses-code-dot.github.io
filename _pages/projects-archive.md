## DNS Spoofing Detection Simulator
DNS spoofing poses a significant threat by allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious sites, enabling phishing, data theft, or man-in-the-middle attacks. Lack of accessible, safe tools to study and simulate these attacks hinders effective education and defense strategy development, necessitating a user-friendly simulator to illustrate DNS vulnerabilities. So I'm currently working on a project focused on DNS spoofing, utilizing a pre-captured dataset to develop a web-based simulator. This tool aims to demonstrate how DNS spoofing attacks manipulate network traffic in a controlled environment, enhancing understanding of cybersecurity threats.
From what I have done, I have:
 - Analyzed Captured Dataset: Successfully examined a pre-existing DNS traffic dataset to identify patterns or vulnerabilities exploitable in DNS spoofing attacks.
 - Developed Web-Based Simulator: Built a functional web-based tool to simulate DNS spoofing, allowing controlled demonstration of attack scenarios.
 - Visualized Attack Process: Created an interactive interface in the simulator to showcase how DNS queries are intercepted and manipulated.
 - Enhanced Understanding: Provided a user-friendly way to study DNS spoofing mechanics without requiring live network manipulation.
